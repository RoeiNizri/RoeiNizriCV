          My time at PlasBit was both professionally fulfilling and personally meaningful.
          I believed in what we were building, and I gave it my all.
          However, I found myself at a difficult turning point when it became clear that certain practices at the ownership level did not align with legal or ethical expectations.
          Staying true to my ethical principles, I made the hard but necessary decision to move on and continue my journey with integrity at the forefront.
