        Hey there! I'm Roei, a passionate B.Sc Software Engineering student who loves diving into code
        like a kid into a candy store. With hands-on experience in crafting everything from eye-popping OpenGL
        graphics to robust full-stack applications and clever AI algorithms, I'm always up for a coding challenge.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
        I'm a tech enthusiast with a knack for multiple programming languages and technologies. My areas of interest
        span across medical solutions, financial solutions, artificial intelligence, and blockchain â€“ yes, I'm a bit of
        a blockchain expert too! Whether it's building a life-saving app, optimizing financial transactions, creating
        smart AI systems, or exploring the future of decentralized tech, I'm your go-to developer.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Beyond coding, I bring a wealth of experience from customer service and management roles. I know how to lead
        teams, keep projects on track, and deliver results under pressure. When I'm not coding, you might find me
        brainstorming the next big idea or enjoying some quality downtime. By the way, when I'm not buried in code, I'm either hitting the gym, getting lost in a good book, playing the piano, or just enjoying life's simple pleasures. Curious to know more? Keep browsing!
